# Chapter 12: Conclusion and Future Scope

In this book, we have explored the various aspects of Low Latency Option Volatility Estimation in C++. We first started with a brief overview of the financial markets and their importance in our lives. We then delved into the intricacies of option trading and how option volatility plays a key role in this domain.

We discovered that the current methods for volatility estimation are far from perfect and have many drawbacks, chief among them being slow speeds and high computational complexity.

# Chapter 12: Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Missing Volatility

Sherlock Holmes was busy solving a new case when he received a phone call from his old friend, Dr. Watson. Watson had been working on an algorithm for low latency option volatility estimation in C++, but he had hit a roadblock. He had discovered that his algorithm was giving inconsistent results, and he could not figure out why. He had come to Holmes for help.

Holmes immediately set to work, examining Watson's code and data. He noticed that the volatility estimates were not consistent across different time periods, and sometimes even within the same time period. This was strange, as even a small inconsistency could lead to significant losses in the financial markets.

Holmes spent hours examining the code and data, but he could not find any obvious errors. He then turned to Watson and asked him to explain his algorithm in detail. Watson explained that he had used historical data to estimate option volatility, and had used a moving average method to update the estimate in real-time. Holmes was intrigued, and asked Watson to explain the moving average method in detail.

Watson explained that the moving average method calculated a rolling average of the historical volatility estimates, and then used this average as the current estimate. However, Holmes immediately noticed a flaw in this method. He realized that the weights used in the calculation of the rolling average would change every time a new estimate was added. This meant that the current estimate was not based on the same historical data as the previous estimate, leading to inconsistencies in the results.

Holmes then suggested a simple modification to Watson's algorithm, where the weights for the rolling average would be precomputed and stored in memory. This would ensure that the current estimate was based on the same historical data as the previous estimate, leading to consistent and accurate results.

Watson was amazed by this simple yet effective solution, and thanked Holmes for his help. Together, they implemented this modification and were delighted to see that the algorithm was now giving consistent and accurate results.

In conclusion, Holmes had solved the mystery of the missing volatility by identifying a flaw in Watson's moving average method, and suggesting a simple modification to address it. This showed that even the most sophisticated algorithms could have simple errors that could lead to significant losses if not identified and addressed in a timely manner.
To resolve the mystery of the missing volatility, Sherlock Holmes suggested a simple modification to the moving average method used by Dr. Watson’s algorithm. In this section, we will explain the code used to implement this modification.

## The Problem

The moving average method used by Dr. Watson’s algorithm calculated the rolling average of historical volatility estimates. However, the weights used in the calculation of the rolling average changed every time a new estimate was added. This resulted in inconsistencies in the results, as the current estimate was not based on the same historical data as the previous estimate.

## The Solution

Holmes suggested a modification to the algorithm, whereby the weights for the rolling average would be precomputed and stored in memory. This would ensure that the current estimate was based on the same historical data as the previous estimate, leading to consistent and accurate results.

```c++
// Compute the weights for the rolling average
double weights[n];
double sumWeights = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
{
    weights[i] = exp(-alpha * i);
    sumWeights += weights[i];
}
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
{
    weights[i] /= sumWeights;
}

// Calculate the rolling average
double rollingAverage = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
{
    rollingAverage += weights[i] * historicalData[i];
}

// Update the estimate
double estimate = rollingAverage;
```

In the modified code, we first compute the weights for the rolling average and store them in an array. We then normalize the weights so that their sum is equal to 1. This ensures that the rolling average is a weighted average of the historical volatility estimates. Finally, we calculate the rolling average using the precomputed weights and use it to update the estimate.

## Conclusion

The modification suggested by Sherlock Holmes was simple yet effective in ensuring consistent and accurate results in the low latency option volatility estimation algorithm. This highlights the importance of careful algorithm design and code optimization in the financial markets, where even small errors can lead to significant losses.
