# Chapter 7: Monte Carlo Simulation for Option Pricing

In the previous chapter, we discussed the implementation of the Black-Scholes model for option pricing. However, the Black-Scholes model has several assumptions that might not hold in the real-world scenario. For instance, it assumes that the stock price follows a log-normal distribution, which might not hold in practice.

One of the alternatives to the Black-Scholes model is Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical method that uses random sampling to estimate complex mathematical problems. It has several applications in finance, including option pricing.

In this chapter, we will discuss the implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation for option pricing. We will start by discussing the basics of Monte Carlo simulation and its application in option pricing. Then, we will see how we can implement the Monte Carlo simulation in C++. We will also discuss the various optimization techniques that we can use to improve the performance of Monte Carlo simulation.

Finally, we will compare the performance of the Monte Carlo simulation with the Black-Scholes model and see which one performs better for option pricing. By the end of this chapter, you will have a good understanding of the Monte Carlo simulation and its use in option pricing. So, let’s get started!

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were sitting in their living room, enjoying a game of chess when a frantic knock on the door interrupted them. A disheveled man entered the room and collapsed onto the couch.

"What happened?" Sherlock asked.

"I'm ruined!" the man cried. "I've lost everything in the stock market!"

"Please calm down," Dr. Watson said, handing him a glass of water. "Tell us what happened."

"I invested heavily in options," the man said. "And I relied on the Black-Scholes model for pricing them. But the model failed me. I need your help to figure out a better way to price options."

Sherlock sat up in his chair, intrigued. "Tell us about your investments."

The man explained that he had purchased call options on a stock, expecting it to rise in value. However, the stock's price had gone down instead, causing all his options to expire worthless.

"So, you were using the Black-Scholes model to price these options," Sherlock said.

"Yes, I relied on the model's assumptions about log-normal distribution," the man replied. "But it clearly failed me. Is there a better way to price options?"

Sherlock pondered for a moment before replying, "Have you heard of Monte Carlo simulation?"

## The Resolution

Sherlock explained that Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical method that uses random sampling to estimate complex mathematical problems, including option pricing.

"You can use Monte Carlo simulation to generate a large number of possible future price paths for the underlying stock," Sherlock said. "These paths will provide a distribution of possible future prices, and you can use them to estimate the option's value."

Sherlock then showed the man how to implement Monte Carlo simulation in C++. He explained how to generate random stock price paths based on the stock's historical volatility and how to calculate option values based on these paths.

The man was impressed with the approach and asked how it compared to the Black-Scholes model.

Sherlock ran several simulations using both methods and compared the results. He showed how Monte Carlo simulation was more accurate in estimating the option's value, especially for more complex options.

"Now that you have a better understanding of Monte Carlo simulation," Sherlock said, "you can use it to make more informed investment decisions."

The man was grateful for Sherlock's help and left the apartment with a new-found appreciation for the power of Monte Carlo simulation in option pricing.

## Explanation of the Code

To implement Monte Carlo simulation in C++, we can use the following steps:

1. Generate random stock price paths based on the stock's historical volatility.
2. Calculate option values based on the generated price paths.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 multiple times to get a distribution of possible option values.
4. Take the average of all the option values to get the estimated option value.

First, we need to generate random stock price paths. We can do this using the Black-Scholes model's formula for calculating the stock price at each time step. The formula is:

```
S(t+Δt) = S(t) * e^((r-0.5*σ^2)Δt + σ*√(Δt)*Z)
```

where S(t) is the stock price at time t, r is the risk-free interest rate, σ is the stock's historical volatility, Δt is the time step, and Z is a standard normal distribution.

We can use the following C++ code to generate random stock price paths:

```c++
double stockPrice(double currentPrice, double riskFree, double volatility, double time) {
    const double Z = normal_distribution(generator);
    const double drift = riskFree - 0.5 * volatility * volatility;
    const double diffusion = volatility * sqrt(time) * Z;
    return currentPrice * exp(drift * time + diffusion);
}
```

where `currentPrice` is the current stock price, `riskFree` is the risk-free interest rate, `volatility` is the historical volatility, and `time` is the time step.

Next, we can calculate the option value based on the generated stock price paths. We can use the following C++ code to calculate the option value:

```c++
double optionValue(double currentPrice, double strike, double riskFree, double volatility, double time) {
    const double stock = stockPrice(currentPrice, riskFree, volatility, time);
    const double payoff = max(stock - strike, 0.0);
    const double discountedPayoff = payoff * exp(-riskFree * time);
    return discountedPayoff;
}
```

where `currentPrice` is the current stock price, `strike` is the option's strike price, `riskFree` is the risk-free interest rate, `volatility` is the historical volatility, and `time` is the time left until the option expires.

We can run the above code multiple times to get a distribution of possible option values. Finally, we can take the average of all the option values to get the estimated option value.

```c++
double callOptionMonteCarlo(double currentPrice, double strike, double riskFree, double volatility, double time,
                            int numPaths) {
    double total = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numPaths; i++) {
        const double option = optionValue(currentPrice, strike, riskFree, volatility, time);
        total += option;
    }
    return total / numPaths;
}
```

where `numPaths` is the number of times we need to run the Monte Carlo simulation.

In conclusion, Monte Carlo simulation can be implemented in C++ using the above code to estimate the option's value based on the stock's historical volatility.
