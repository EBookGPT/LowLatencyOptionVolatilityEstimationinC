# Chapter 3: Understanding Option Pricing Models

Welcome back to our journey in learning about option pricing and low latency volatility estimation in C++. In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of C++ for option pricing. We learned about the different types of option contracts, the Black-Scholes formula, and how to calculate option prices using Monte Carlo simulation.

Now, we move on to the next step - understanding option pricing models. For this chapter, we have a special guest - Fischer Black. Fischer Black, along with Myron Scholes, developed the Nobel Prize-winning Black-Scholes model which revolutionized the way we price options.

In this chapter, we will first take a deeper look into the Black-Scholes model and how it works. We will then explore other popular pricing models such as the Binomial and Trinomial Tree models, the Heston model, and the SABR model. We will compare these models and discuss the pros and cons of each.

Once we understand these models, we can then move on to discussing how to implement them in C++. We will go through the steps of importing the necessary libraries, setting up the variables and functions, and finally, calculating the prices of options.

Throughout the chapter, we will also touch upon the importance of low latency in option pricing. We will demonstrate how we can reduce the computational time of our pricing models using various techniques such as parallelization and caching.

So buckle up and get ready to delve deeper into option pricing! Let's see what mysteries we can solve with Fischer Black by our side.
# Chapter 3: Understanding Option Pricing Models

## The Sherlock Holmes Mystery: The Case of the Missing Option Price

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were called upon by wealthy investor Mr. John Smith to investigate a mysterious disappearance. Mr. Smith had invested in a particular option contract, and was expecting to receive a dividend payment on the underlying asset of the option. However, when the payment date arrived, Mr. Smith found that he had not received any payment.

When Mr. Smith attempted to calculate the value of his option contract using the Black-Scholes model, he found that the result was not accurate. The price calculated by the model was significantly lower than expected, leading Mr. Smith to suspect foul play.

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were tasked with finding out what had happened to the missing payment and investigating the accuracy of the Black-Scholes model.

## The Resolution

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson began their investigation by looking into the possible causes of the missing payment. They soon discovered that the dividend payment was in fact made, but it had been delayed due to a technical issue with the payment system. With this issue resolved, Mr. Smith finally received his payment.

However, the mystery surrounding the accuracy of the Black-Scholes model remained. To solve this, the duo called upon the expertise of Fischer Black, one of the creators of the model.

With Fischer Black on their side, they began to investigate the reasons behind the inaccurate pricing of Mr. Smith's option contract. They soon discovered that the option contract was on a stock that was known to have high volatility. This was resulting in the actual volatility of the stock being higher than the volatility estimated by the Black-Scholes model. As a result, the model was undervaluing the option, leading to the lower-than-expected price.

Using this knowledge, Fischer Black helped to adjust the pricing model by incorporating more accurate volatility estimates. The resulting price was closer to the expected value of the option contract.

Additionally, Fischer Black taught them about other pricing models such as the Binomial and Trinomial Tree models, which can be used to more accurately price options on assets with high volatility. He also introduced them to the Heston model, which is better suited for options on assets with stochastic volatility.

With their investigation complete, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson had solved the case of the missing payment and learned a great deal about option pricing models. They also learned the importance of incorporating accurate volatility estimates in their pricing models, which can be achieved through low latency volatility estimation in C++.

## Conclusion

Through this mystery, we have learned the importance of accurate pricing models in option pricing, and how we can achieve this using low latency volatility estimation in C++. We have explored popular pricing models such as the Black-Scholes, Binomial and Trinomial Tree, Heston, and the SABR model.

We have also discussed techniques to reduce computational time, which is crucial in achieving low latency pricing. With the insights gained from Fischer Black, we are now better equipped to make accurate and efficient pricing of options.

So, whether you're a seasoned investor or just starting out, remember the importance of reliable pricing, and make use of these low latency techniques to ensure your success in option trading!
# Understanding the Code Used to Resolve the Sherlock Holmes Mystery

To solve the mystery of the missing option payment, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson called on the expertise of Fischer Black to help them understand and implement accurate option pricing models. In this section, we will explore the code used to resolve the mystery and calculate the correct price of the option.

## Accurate Volatility Estimation

One of the main reasons for the inaccuracy of the Black-Scholes model in pricing the option was due to the underestimated volatility of the stock. To address this issue, we can use more accurate volatility estimates in our calculations.

One way to achieve this is through low latency volatility estimation in C++. Here's an example of how we can calculate the historical volatility of a stock using C++:

```c++
// Import necessary libraries
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

// Define function to calculate historical volatility
double historical_volatility(const std::vector<double>& prices)
{
    // Define variables
    double sum = 0.0;
    double mean = 0.0;
    double variance = 0.0;
    double stdev = 0.0;

    // Calculate mean
    for (auto& price : prices)
    {
        sum += price;
    }
    mean = sum / prices.size();

    // Calculate variance
    for (auto& price : prices)
    {
        variance += pow(price - mean, 2);
    }
    variance /= (prices.size() - 1);

    // Calculate standard deviation
    stdev = sqrt(variance);

    // Calculate annualized historical volatility
    const double annualization = sqrt(252.0); // 252 trading days in a year
    return stdev * annualization;
}
```

This code takes in a vector of historical stock prices and calculates the annualized historical volatility using the standard deviation of the prices.

By incorporating this function to accurately estimate volatility, we can adjust our Black-Scholes model and produce more accurate option prices.

## Other Pricing Models

In addition to the Black-Scholes model, other pricing models can also be used to more accurately price options on assets with high volatility.

One such model is the Heston model, which takes into account stochastic volatility, making it more appropriate for such assets. Here's an example of how we can implement the Heston model in C++:

```c++
// Import necessary libraries
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>

// Define necessary constants
const double T = 1.0; // Time to maturity
const double mu = 0.1; // Drift rate
const double kappa = 1.0; // Mean reversion rate
const double theta = 0.1; // Long run variance
const double rho = -0.6; // Correlation coefficient
const double sigma = 0.2; // Volatility of volatility
const double S0 = 100; // Initial stock price

// Define necessary functions
std::complex<double> cgf(double u)
{
    std::complex<double> iu(0.0, 1.0);
    std::complex<double> A = iu * u * mu;
    std::complex<double> B = (kappa - rho * sigma * iu * u);
    std::complex<double> C = theta * kappa / pow(sigma, 2);

    std::complex<double> D = pow(B, 2) - 4.0 * A * C;
    std::complex<double> temp1 = 2.0 * C / sigma / sigma;
    std::complex<double> temp2 = 2.0 * B / pow(sigma, 2);

    return (temp1 * log(temp2 + sqrt(D)) - pow(B, 2) / pow(sigma, 2) / D) * T;
}

double HestonOptionPrice(double strike, double r)
{
    const double K = strike;
    const double r_ = r;
    double xMin = -10.0;
    double xMax = 10.0;
    const int N = 1000;
    double dx = (xMax - xMin) / (N - 1);

    double P = 0.5;
    double a = 0.0;
    double b = 0.0;
    double t = 0.0;
    double A = 0.0;
    double B = 0.0;
    double temp = 0.0;
    double u = 0.0;
    double integral1 = 0.0;
    double integral2 = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
    {
        x = i * dx + xMin;
        t = exp(x);
        A = (cgf(t - iu) - cgf(-iu)) / (iu * t);
        B = (cgf(t + iu) - cgf(iu)) / (-iu * t);
        a = P * (B.real() + A.real()) * exp(-r_ * T) * dx / 2.0;
        b = P * (B.imag() + A.imag()) * exp(-r_ * T) * dx / 2.0;
        temp = (a + b) / pi * sin(pi * u * x / (xMax - xMin)) / (u * x / (xMax - xMin));
        integral1 += temp * cos(u * pi / 2.0);
        integral2 += temp * sin(u * pi / 2.0);
    }

    return K * (0.5 + integral1) - S0 * exp(-r_ * T) * (0.5 + integral2);
}
```

This code uses the Heston model to calculate the price of an option on a stock with stochastic volatility, given a strike price and a risk-free rate.

By using these various pricing models and low latency techniques, we can achieve accurate and efficient pricing of options, just as Fischer Black did.
