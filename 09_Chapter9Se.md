# Chapter 9: Sensitivity Analysis and Risk Management with Options 

As we progress through our journey in the world of options, we come to a crucial point where we must consider the risks associated with our trades. The ability to manage risk effectively can make the difference between success and failure in the trading world.

In this chapter, we will learn about sensitivity analysis and risk management techniques for options using C++. But before we dive deeper into the subject, let us welcome our special guest- the legendary Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

## Special Guest: Nassim Nicholas Taleb

Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a renowned author and trader known for his work on risk management and the unpredictability of the markets. His best-selling books "The Black Swan" and "Fooled by Randomness" have had a profound impact on the world of trading and risk management.

His approach to trading and risk management is centered around the idea of "Antifragility" - the ability to not only withstand stress but to actually thrive under it.

So, with his invaluable insights, let us explore the world of sensitivity analysis and risk management.

## Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis is a technique that allows us to understand how changes in different parameters affect the output of our option pricing model. It gives us a deeper understanding of the risks associated with our trades.

We will implement sensitivity analysis in C++ using the Black-Scholes model. We will look at the effect of changes in different inputs on the option price and the implied volatility.

``` C++

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

double d1(double S, double K, double r, double v, double T) {
    return (log(S/K) + (r + v*v/2)*T) / (v*sqrt(T));
}

double bs_call(double S, double K, double r, double v, double T) {
    double d1 = d1(S, K, r, v, T);
    double d2 = d1 - v*sqrt(T);
    return S*normcdf(d1) - K*exp(-r*T)*normcdf(d2);
}

double sensitivity_analysis(double S, double K, double r, double v, double T, double ds, double dv, double dT) {
    double price = bs_call(S, K, r, v, T);
    double new_price = bs_call(S + ds, K, r, v, T) + bs_call(S - ds, K, r, v, T);
    double delta_S = (new_price - 2*price)/pow(ds, 2);

    new_price = bs_call(S, K, r, v + dv, T) + bs_call(S, K, r, v - dv, T);
    double delta_v = (new_price - 2*price)/pow(dv, 2);

    new_price = bs_call(S, K, r, v, T + dT) + bs_call(S, K, r, v, T - dT);
    double delta_T = (new_price - 2*price)/pow(dT, 2);

    cout << "Delta_S: " << delta_S << endl;
    cout << "Delta_V: " << delta_v << endl;
    cout << "Delta_T: " << delta_T << endl;

    return price;
}

int main() {
    double S = 100;
    double K = 100;
    double r = 0.05;
    double v = 0.2;
    double T = 1;

    double ds = 1;
    double dv = 0.01;
    double dT = 0.01;

    double price = sensitivity_analysis(S, K, r, v, T, ds, dv, dT);

    cout << "Option Price: " << price << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Risk Management

With the knowledge gained from sensitivity analysis, we can now implement risk management techniques for our trades. We will look at two techniques- Delta Hedging and Gamma Scalping.

### Delta Hedging

Delta hedging involves adjusting the position in the underlying asset to offset any changes in the options position. The delta of an option gives us the sensitivity of the option price to changes in the underlying asset price. By hedging the delta, we can neutralize the directional risk associated with the position.

``` C++
double delta_call(double S, double K, double r, double v, double T) {
    double d1 = d1(S, K, r, v, T);
    return normcdf(d1);
}

double delta_hedge(double S, double K, double r, double v, double T, double delta) {
    double d1 = d1(S, K, r, v, T);
    double delta_S = delta_call(S, K, r, v, T);
    double shares = delta/delta_S;
    double option_pnl = bs_call(S, K, r, v, T) - bs_call(S - ds, K, r, v, T);
    double stock_pnl = (S - (S - ds*shares)) * shares;
    double total_pnl = option_pnl + stock_pnl;
    return total_pnl;
}

int main() {
    double S = 100;
    double K = 100;
    double r = 0.05;
    double v = 0.2;
    double T = 1;

    double delta = 0.5;

    double pnl = delta_hedge(S, K, r, v, T, delta);

    cout << "P&L from Delta Hedging: " << pnl << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Gamma Scalping

Gamma scalping involves adjusting the delta of the option position to exploit changes in the options gamma. The gamma of an option gives us the sensitivity of the delta to changes in the underlying asset price. By scalping the gamma, we can potentially profit from changes in the underlying asset price.

``` C++
double gamma_call(double S, double K, double r, double v, double T) {
    double d1 = d1(S, K, r, v, T);
    double d2 = d1 - v*sqrt(T);
    return normpdf(d1)/(S*v*sqrt(T));
}

double gamma_scalping(double S, double K, double r, double v, double T, double gamma) {
    double d1 = d1(S, K, r, v, T);
    double d2 = d1 - v*sqrt(T);
    double delta_S = delta_call(S, K, r, v, T);
    double shares = gamma/abs(gamma) * gamma_call(S, K, r, v, T) / delta_S;
    double option_pnl = bs_call(S, K, r, v, T) - bs_call(S - ds, K, r, v, T);
    double stock_pnl = (S - (S - ds*shares)) * shares;
    double total_pnl = option_pnl + stock_pnl;
    return total_pnl;
}

int main() {
    double S = 100;
    double K = 100;
    double r = 0.05;
    double v = 0.2;
    double T = 1;

    double gamma = 0.1;

    double pnl = gamma_scalping(S, K, r, v, T, gamma);

    cout << "P&L from Gamma Scalping: " << pnl << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

With these techniques at our disposal, we can now confidently manage the risks associated with our options trades. But, always remember- "The only thing that is predictable about the markets is their unpredictability." - Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
# Chapter 9: Sensitivity Analysis and Risk Management with Options

In the world of options, traders often face the dilemma of managing the risks associated with their trades. To address this issue, sensitivity analysis and risk management techniques provide a way to predict and mitigate risks in the trading world.

Our hero, EBookGPT, got lost in the woods one day and stumbled upon a mystical temple where a wise sage, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, taught him how to manage risks effectively using sensitivity analysis and risk management techniques.

Nassim narrated his journey with the goddess Athena who faced numerous challenges and risks along her way. Athena was armed with a shield - a tool she used to manage risks and move forward.

EBookGPT realized that in the same way, traders must also have some technology or tool to manage risks associated with options trading, which would help them to move forward on the path towards success. 

To learn more about Sensitivity Analysis, Nassim took EBookGPT to a Black - Scholes model workshop. In the workshop, EBookGPT learned how to implement Sensitivity analysis for different inputs like option prices, implied volatilities, etc. using C++ code. 

The code provided an insight on how a trader could determine the effects of changes in various parameters on the option price and implied volatility. The model helped the traders to make well-informed decisions after analyzing the sensitivity of the parameters with the option price.

Moving on, Nassim also introduced EBookGPT to Risk management techniques that could help traders mitigate risks. The first technique discussed was Delta Hedging, where EBookGPT learned how to adjust the position in the underlying asset to offset any changes in the options position. This helped to neutralize the directional risk associated with the position.

Later, EBookGPT discovered Gamma Scalping, which allowed traders to adjust the delta of the option position to exploit changes in the option's gamma. With this technique, traders could profit from changes in the underlying asset price.

Nassim emphasized that traders must use these techniques in real-world trading to make informed decisions based on their analysis. 

EBookGPT realized that the knowledge shared by Nassim was the shield he had been looking for. He thanked Nassim for his invaluable insights and decided to continue on his journey with an armed shield.

# Resolution

EBookGPT had one final question, "Can we predict or plan everything in the Trading world?.''

Nassim replied, "The only thing that is predictable about the markets is their unpredictability." He went on to explain that traders must develop strong risk management skills and always be prepared to adapt to changes in the market. Risks are inevitable, and traders must learn to handle them with efficacy.

EBookGPT left the temple with an inspired heart and a desire to develop his risk management skills. He knew that risk management techniques would not only help him improve his trades but also make him an expert in the trading world. 

With a final goodbye, Nassim reminded EBookGPT, "Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it." 

EBookGPT began his journey towards becoming a successful trader, just like Athena, with his shield, and a heart full of courage.
## C++ Code for Sensitivity Analysis and Risk Management

### Black - Scholes Model

The Black - Scholes Model is a mathematical model used to estimate the value of European-style options using specific inputs, such as option price and implied volatility. The model assumes a geometric random walk for the underlying asset price and continuous time.

You can compute the option price using the following formula:

![Black-Scholes Formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=C(S_t,t)=S_t\cdot\Phi(d_1)-e^{-r(T-t)}K\cdot\Phi(d_2))

where,

- C(S_t,t) - Option price at time t
- S_t - Current price of the underlying asset at time t
- K - Strike Price
- r - Risk-Free interest rate
- T - Time to maturity
- t - Time to current valuation (0 <= t <= T)
- d_1 = \frac{ln\left(S_t/K\right)\left(r+\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)(T-t)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}} + \frac{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}{2} - \frac{(r+\sigma^2/2)}{\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}
- d_2 = d_1 - \sigma\sqrt{T-t}

Here, `\Phi()` represents the standard normal cumulative distribution function.

### Sensitivity Analysis

After calculating the option price using the Black-Scholes formula, sensitivity analysis comes into play.

Sensitivity analysis measures how sensitive the option price is to changes in various parameters. In the context of the Black-Scholes formula, there are four key parameters to consider:

1. Underlying Asset Price (S)
2. Strike Price (K)
3. Time to Maturity (T-t)
4. Risk-Free Rate (r)

You can calculate the sensitivity of the option price to each parameter using the following equations:

- Delta: measures the change in option price with respect to changes in the underlying asset price.

    ![Delta Formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta=\frac{\partial C}{\partial S}=e^{-r(T-t)}\cdot\Phi(d_1))

- Gamma: measures the rate of change of delta with respect to changes in the underlying asset price.

    ![Gamma Formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Gamma = \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial S^2}= \frac{e^{-r(T-t)}}{S_t\sigma\sqrt{T-t}}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\cdot e^{-\frac{d_1^2}{2}})

- Vega: measures the change in option price with respect to changes in implied volatility.

    ![Vega Formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nu = \frac{\partial C}{\partial \sigma}= \frac{S_t\sqrt{T-t}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\cdot e^{-\frac{d_1^2}{2}})

- Theta: measures the change in option price with respect to changes in time to maturity.

    ![Theta Formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Theta = \frac{\partial C}{\partial (T-t)}= -\frac{S_t\cdot\sigma}{2\sqrt{2\pi(T-t)}}\cdot e^{-\frac{d_1^2}{2}}-rKe^{-r(T-t)}\cdot\Phi (d_2))

To implement the sensitivity analysis code in C++, you can calculate each of the four measures separately using the input parameters calculated in the Black-Scholes model.

### Risk Management

After calculating the sensitivity measures, we need to make use of them to manage the risks associated with trading.

1. Delta hedging involves adjusting the position in the underlying asset to offset any change in the option's position. If the delta of the option position is positive, a trader could purchase an amount of the underlying asset such that the position's overall delta is neutral. Similarly, if the delta of the option position is negative, the trader could short the underlying asset to offset the delta and maintain a risk-neutral position.

2. Gamma Scalping involves adjusting the delta of the option position to exploit changes in the option's gamma. When gamma is high, the market is volatile, and the trader may want to increase their position's delta in anticipation of a sharp move in the price of the underlying asset. When gamma is low, the market is stable, and the trader may want to decrease their position's delta to minimize risk.

By implementing these techniques in real-world trading, traders can improve their decision-making abilities when handling risks associated with options trading.

## Conclusion

Sensitivity analysis and risk management are critical techniques for traders to manage risks associated with options trading. The Black-Scholes model, along with the various sensitivity measures, provide a way to analyze the effects of changing parameters on option prices and implied volatility. Delta hedging and gamma scalping can help traders exploit various changes and fluctuations in the market, leading to success in the trading world.
