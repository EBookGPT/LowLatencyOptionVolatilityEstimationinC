## Chapter 6: Black-Scholes Model Implementation

**"The adventure of the Black-Scholes Model"**

As we have seen in the previous chapter, estimating option volatility is a key component in valuing options. In this chapter, we will investigate the Black-Scholes Model, which is one of the most widely-used pricing models for options.

The Black-Scholes Model calculates the theoretical price of an option using various parameters like the current underlying asset price, the option strike price, option expiration time, the risk-free interest rate and the estimated volatility of the underlying asset.

Through this chapter, we will walk through the implementation of the Black-Scholes model in C++, discuss the concepts in detail, and work on creating a low latency option volatility estimation model.

We will start by reviewing the theoretical background of the Black-Scholes Model and in the process, we will revisit some of the concepts introduced in the historical volatility estimation chapter.  We will then tailor this information to build a high-performance implementation that can process market data at lightning speed using C++ optimization techniques.

To solve the mystery, we will investigate the case of a trader who was baffled when an option he owned lost a lot of value overnight. It was only after he noticed the implied volatility of the option spiked that he was able to trace the reason back to a major event that rocked the market. We will use our Black-Scholes model to analyze the option pricing behavior around this event.

So, buckle up and get ready for another exciting chapter on estimating option volatility, the Black-Scholes way and leave no stone unturned in our bid to solve the mystery.

**"The adventure of the Black-Scholes Model"**

It was a dark and stormy night when Sherlock Holmes received a call from an old friend, a trader who was in need of his assistance. The trader had invested heavily in options and woke up to find that the value of his options had significantly decreased overnight. Despite monitoring the market closely, he was unable to identify any significant events that could explain the sudden drop in value.

Sherlock Holmes took the case, and he immediately began his investigation. He asked the trader for the option details, and after reviewing them, he noticed that the implied volatility of the option had spiked overnight. This was an unusual behavior since the implied volatility should not change suddenly without any significant event occurring in the market.

Sherlock Holmes knew at this point that estimating implied volatility was crucial in solving this mystery. He turned to the Black-Scholes Model, widely used for option pricing, and used C++ to build a low latency volatility estimator that could process market data at lightning speed. He then analyzed the trading pattern of the option before and after the sudden drop in value.

As he delved deeper into his investigation, he found that the option value had dropped because of a significant event that had occurred overnight. A company that was heavily invested in the option had just declared a massive loss, which had sent their stock price plummeting. This led to a significant change in market sentiment, which caused the implied volatility of the option to spike.

Through his use of the Black-Scholes model, Sherlock Holmes was able to trace the trail of events that led to the significant drop in the option value. The model allowed him to not only identify the cause of the problem but also to estimate the magnitude of the price swing that occurred.

Thanks to the Black-Scholes formula, Sherlock Holmes was able to prove that the root of the cause of the trader's woes was tied to the market and not the trader's original investment strategy. He advised his old friend to stay vigilant and always keep an eye on the implied volatility of his options to avoid stepping into trouble.

With his work completed, Sherlock Holmes left knowing that the case was solved, and the mystery of the sudden option price drop had come to an end. 

## Conclusion

In this chapter, we have illustrated how the Black-Scholes model can be implemented in C++ to estimate option volatility efficiently. We have discussed efficient crossing of data structure boundaries, low-latency message-processing code, and easy-to-read C++11 constructs for high-performance algorithms. 

We hope that you found this exciting journey insightful and will use the knowledge in this chapter to build your own efficient low-latency implementation of option pricing models.
## Chapter 6: Black-Scholes Model Implementation

**"The adventure of the Black-Scholes Model"**

In our Sherlock Holmes mystery, we used the Black-Scholes Model to solve the mystery of a mysterious overnight drop in the value of an option. We employed C++ to create a low latency option volatility estimator that could process market data efficiently.

The Black-Scholes Model requires a few parameters to price options. These parameters are the current underlying asset price, the option strike price, option expiration time, risk-free interest rate, and estimated volatility of the underlying asset. In our case, to calculate the implied volatility of the option, we already had these parameters, except for the estimated volatility.

To calculate the implied volatility, we leveraged the Newton-Raphson method. The method is an iterative algorithm to calculate the roots of a function. In our case, we used this method to find the implied volatility of the option given the option's price and other known inputs.

```c++
double newton_raphson(double t, double s, double k, double r, double c, double sig_est) {
    double sig = sig_est;

    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ITERATIONS; ++i) {
        double d1 = (log(s / k) + (r + sig * sig / 2.0) * t) / (sig * sqrt(t));
        double d2 = d1 - sig * sqrt(t);
        double vega = s * norm_pdf(d1) * sqrt(t);
        double price = s * norm_cdf(d1) - k * exp(-r * t) * norm_cdf(d2);

        sig -= (price - c) / vega;

        if (abs(price - c) < TOLERANCE)
            break;
    }

    return sig;
}
```

Once we have the implied volatility, we can plug in these values into the Black-Scholes formula, which can then calculate the theoretical price of the option. 

```c++
double black_scholes(double t, double s, double k, double r, double sig, bool put) {
    double d1 = (log(s / k) + (r + sig * sig / 2.0) * t) / (sig * sqrt(t));
    double d2 = d1 - sig * sqrt(t);

    double price;
    if (!put) 
        price = s * norm_cdf(d1) - k * exp(-r * t) * norm_cdf(d2);
    else
        price = k * exp(-r * t) * norm_cdf(-d2) - s * norm_cdf(-d1);

    return price;
}
```

Using these functions, we were able to build our low latency option volatility estimator to calculate the implied volatility of the option accurately. We could then analyze the trading behaviors of the option before and after the sudden drop in value and identify the cause of the drop by analyzing the market sentiment. 

By leveraging the power of the Black-Scholes model and C++, we were able to solve the mystery and help the trader identify the root cause of his problem.

We hope that this journey into building a low latency Black-Scholes model in C++ has been insightful for you, and you will use this knowledge to build your own efficient implementation of option pricing models.
