# Chapter 13: Conclusion - Code Explanation

In the story of Robin Hood and the Option Traders, we saw how Robin used his knowledge of Low Latency Option Volatility Estimation in C++ to help the common people. Let's take a closer look at the code he used to develop his low latency option volatility estimation system.

Robin began by implementing the Black-Scholes Model for option pricing. He used the following code to calculate the option price:

```c++
double OptionPrice::BlackScholesPrice(
    double spotPrice,
    double timeToMaturity,
    double strikePrice,
    double riskFreeRate,
    double volatility,
    OptionType optionType
) {
    double d1 = (log(spotPrice / strikePrice) + (riskFreeRate + (volatility * volatility) / 2) * timeToMaturity) / (volatility * sqrt(timeToMaturity));
    double d2 = d1 - volatility * sqrt(timeToMaturity);
    if (optionType == CALL)
        return spotPrice * N(d1) - strikePrice * exp(-riskFreeRate * timeToMaturity) * N(d2);
    else
        return strikePrice * exp(-riskFreeRate * timeToMaturity) * N(-d2) - spotPrice * N(-d1);
}
```

Next, Robin used Monte Carlo Simulation for option pricing. He used the following code to calculate the option price:

```c++
double OptionPrice::MonteCarloPrice(
    double spotPrice,
    double timeToMaturity,
    double strikePrice,
    double riskFreeRate,
    double volatility,
    OptionType optionType,
    int numSimulations
) {
    double dt = timeToMaturity / numSimulations;
    double drift = exp((riskFreeRate - (volatility * volatility) / 2) * dt);
    double spotPriceDiscounted = spotPrice * exp(-riskFreeRate * timeToMaturity);
    double sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < numSimulations; i++) {
        double eps = GetStandardNormal();
        double randomSpotPrice = spotPrice * drift * exp(volatility * sqrt(dt) * eps);
        double discountedPayoff = exp(-riskFreeRate * timeToMaturity) * GetPayoff(randomSpotPrice, strikePrice, optionType);
        sum += discountedPayoff;
    }
    double mean = sum / numSimulations;
    return mean;
}
```

Next, Robin implemented Vanilla Option Pricing using Binomial Trees. He used the following code to calculate the option price:

```c++
double OptionPrice::BinomialTreePrice(
    double spotPrice,
    double timeToMaturity,
    double strikePrice,
    double riskFreeRate,
    double volatility,
    OptionType optionType,
    int numSteps
) {
    double dt = timeToMaturity / numSteps;
    double u = exp(volatility * sqrt(dt));
    double d = 1 / u;
    double p = (exp(riskFreeRate * dt) - d) / (u - d);
    vector<double> prices(numSteps + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < numSteps + 1; i++) {
        prices[i] = spotPrice * pow(u, numSteps - i) * pow(d, i);
    }
    vector<double> values(numSteps + 1);
    for (int i = 0; i < numSteps + 1; i++) {
        values[i] = GetPayoff(prices[i], strikePrice, optionType);
    }
    for (int i = numSteps - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (int j = 0; j < i + 1; j++) {
            values[j] = (1 / exp(riskFreeRate * dt)) * (p * values[j] + (1 - p) * values[j + 1]);
        }
    }
    return values[0];
}
```

Finally, Robin used Real-Time Data Processing using C++ to create a low-latency option volatility estimation system. He used the following code to receive real-time market data:

```c++
MarketData MarketDataFeed::GetData(string symbol) {
    // Fetch market data for the given symbol from the exchange
    // and return it as a MarketData object
}
```

He then used the following code to calculate the implied volatility and return it to his trading system:

```c++
double VolatilityEstimation::GetImpliedVolatility(double price,
    double spotPrice,
    double timeToMaturity,
    double strikePrice,
    double riskFreeRate,
    OptionType optionType
) {
    double eps = 1e-4;
    double vol = 0.5;
    double diff = price - OptionPrice::BlackScholesPrice(spotPrice, timeToMaturity, strikePrice, riskFreeRate, vol, optionType);
    while (abs(diff) > eps) {
        vol += (diff / Vega(spotPrice, timeToMaturity, strikePrice, riskFreeRate, vol));
        diff = price - OptionPrice::BlackScholesPrice(spotPrice, timeToMaturity, strikePrice, riskFreeRate, vol, optionType);
    }
    return vol;
}
```

In the end, Robin's low latency option volatility estimation system in C++ allowed him to compete with the option traders and help the common people. By understanding the basics of C++ for option pricing, Option Pricing Models, Historical Volatility Estimation Techniques, and Real-Time Data Processing using C++, Robin was able to create an efficient and effective system for successful trading.
